# Priority-Task-Scheduler-Project
This project helps users manage tasks by taking input like name, due date, priority, duration, and dependencies. It schedules tasks based on priority and handles dependencies with an aging mechanism to avoid starvation. A user-friendly GUI shows execution order, waiting time, and alerts for better planning.
